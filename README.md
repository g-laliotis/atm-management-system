A professional ATM management system written in C with advanced features including real-time notifications, password encryption, and enhanced UI.

## Features

### Core Features
- User registration and login (unique usernames)
- Create new accounts (savings, current, fixed01, fixed02, fixed03)
- Update account information (country, phone number)
- Check account details with interest calculations
- Make transactions (deposit/withdraw) - not allowed for fixed accounts
- Remove accounts
- Transfer account ownership

### Bonus Features ⭐
- ✅ **Password Encryption** - XOR cipher for secure password storage
- ✅ **Enhanced Terminal UI** - Color-coded messages and professional layout
- ✅ **Real-time Notifications** - Named pipes for instant transfer alerts
- ✅ **Professional Structure** - Organized folders (bin/, obj/, include/, etc.)
- ✅ **Custom Makefile** - Advanced build system with multiple targets
- ✅ **SQLite Support** - Optional database backend (commented in code)
- ✅ **Code Optimization** - Modular design with separated utilities

## Interest Rates

- **Savings**: 7% annual (monthly interest)
- **Fixed01** (1 year): 4% annual
- **Fixed02** (2 years): 5% annual
- **Fixed03** (3 years): 8% annual
- **Current**: No interest

```

## Sample Users

- Username: Alice, Password: 1234password
- Username: Michel, Password: password1234

## Real-time Notifications Demo

Open two terminals:

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
./bin/atm
# Login as Alice
# Transfer account to Michel
```

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
./bin/atm
# Login as Michel
# You'll see instant notification when Alice transfers!
```

## Technical Details

- **Language**: C (C99 standard)
- **Threading**: POSIX threads for notifications
- **IPC**: Named pipes (FIFOs)
- **Encryption**: XOR cipher
- **Build System**: GNU Make
- **Optional DB**: SQLite3

## Security

- Passwords are encrypted using XOR cipher before storage
- User authentication validates encrypted credentials
- Account operations require ownership verification

## Development

Compiled with strict warnings:
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c99 -pthread
```

No warnings, clean compilation.
